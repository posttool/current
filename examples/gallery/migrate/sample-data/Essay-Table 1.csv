A work such as Late Madness of Wentworth (1958), with its overwrought title,2 presents an agitated mauve surface, scabrous in parts, inflected by a clotted patch of white that ignites the left center of the composition. The white strokes are thick, an impasto of spackle that casts actual shadow onto the ground. This raised accretion functions as an internal light source, illuminating the mauve and tinting it rose, to suggest that the strokes themselves have the effect that real light might upon the penumbral darkness. An experiment with dry pigments, acrylic resins, and spackle, the painting relates to various European, rather than American, sources. One thinks of Jean Dubuffet’s Texturology paintings from the mid-1950s in terms of surface structure; Jean Fautrier’s compositions plumbing furtive, obscured forms; and Antoni Tàpies’ use of sand as a way of translating darkness and light into pure texture. These European references belie Olitski’s Americanness, for the paintings from the early 1960s, that will serve as his breakthrough work, are characterized by bulbous sweeps of pure color, set within respiring monochromatic grounds. The paintings of late 1959 through the end of 1961 are larger works, and they are devoid of texture—visually and materially completely unlike Late Madness of Wentworth.</P><P> </P><P>To comprehend this apparently sudden shift, which occurred in late 1959, and which in writings about Olitski is characterized as “an abrupt shift in style,”3 or simply, without explanation, registered as an “important change in style,”4 one might rather more closely consider the paintings Olitski was making in the late 1950s, for they may in fact underscore a certain consistency within his artistic thinking. To be sure, there is a fascination with figuration, with the female form, that sets up Olitski’s visual imagination. Ballet Dancer—Waiting (1959), similar in size to Late Madness of Wentworth, equally employs coagulate white spackle as a central occurrence of form, around which more traditional painterly gestures emanate. The organizing white accretion is not merely a formal emblem, but also conveys explicit content. One searches the spackle, which is blended with red into rapidly brushed pink strokes, for semblances of a dancer in motion, glimpses of the flourish of a costume, or other evocations of the ballet. Several works from this period, all of which center around a core of white impasto, carry figurative associations, both in their composition and titling; works such as Lucy Lubric (1959), Untitled (Nude) (1957), or Brown Figure (1957) declare an attachment to the body—explicitly the female body.</P><P> </P><P>Olitski’s fascination with spackle—a glistening, at times even sparkling plaster—presumably originated during his training in sculpture: first in 1947, when he studied in New York with Chaim Gross, and then in Paris, as a student of Ossip Zadkine, from 1949 through the early 1950s. Applied to the surface of the canvas, spackle handles differently than either paint or the liquid resins Olitski was also using at this time. These paintings test the limitations of his materials, seeking passage beyond the dominant gestural standards of Abstract Expressionism. There is a tension about the uneasy blend between the acrylic and the spackle, as Olitski appraised the otherness of his materials. This differential aspect, of the paintings’ physical properties, as well as the often decentered compositions (Late Madness of Wentworth reads like an essay in imbalance), appears to be a hallmark of Olitski’s pictorial thinking, which will recur emphatically throughout his work.</P><P> </P><P>Unlike artists with whom Olitski was closely associated during the early 1960s, such as Kenneth Noland and Frank Stella, his development was staggered, fitful, and driven by experimentation—sometimes yielding insight rapidly, at others more slowly absorbed. Once Noland hit upon the target as an orienting motif, or Stella arrived at his codified black stripe paintings, a certain course was determined for these artists. Especially in the case of Stella, if one reviews his work of 1958, the year immediately preceding the stripe paintings, a very clear progression is evidenced, where gestural possibilities are successively pruned from his compositions and brushwork. In contrast, during these fertile and crucial evolutionary years, Olitski advanced his painting in manifold, lapidary ways, positing possibilities, and even revisiting foreclosed options.</P><P> </P><P>This essay considers the varied work produced at this juncture, and also seeks to assess how best to interpret these paintings, which have been glossed over in critical appraisals of Olitski’s development. Overshadowed perhaps by the more recognizable Core paintings (Olitski’s Color Field works that developed after 1962), and his spray paintings of the mid-1960s, these pivotal works that opened the 1960s for Olitski are both awkward and elegant, probing yet assertive, and summarize the range of possibility encoded within his oeuvre, embryonically mapping his essential creative concerns. How one perceives these paintings today—half a century after they were first exhibited—measures Olitski’s distance from the critical apparatus which defined him as one of the central figures of the formalist debates that characterized the period. Ultimately he evolved beyond that paradigm to define his own path as an artist, one which always sustained an essentially romantic dimension.</P><P> </P><P>In May 1959, an exhibition of Olitski’s impasto paintings was mounted at French &amp; Company. Clement Greenberg, who was serving as a consultant to the gallery, curated the show, which Noland helped to install. The exhibition was favorably received, even admired by critics. And yet, several months later, Olitski painted Mushroom Joy (1959), a work devoid of texture, clarified of painterly incident, and somewhat singular in appearance. Within a smooth, matte, brownish field, two beige orb-like forms appear, hovering at the lower right, ringed by an eccentric red outline. The composition has an otherness about it that is difficult to index for the time. The curvaceous forms that Ellsworth Kelly used, to offset his more rigid geometry, are precise, diverging from the irregular and almost impromptu character of Olitski’s beige and red shapes. Paul Feeley’s syntax has a more geometric and designed logic, situating forms symmetrically, within the rectangle of the canvas, unlike Olitski’s skewed composition. Olitski’s painting also denies the clear balance of Noland’s work at this time, invoking an organic aspect, where Noland’s approach remained purely formal. Olitski’s title, Mushroom Joy, conveys the oddness conjured by his composition, conferring the possibility of emotion on a fungus. As one ponders the beige forms, one wonders about the sentient capacity of toadstools. Close inspection reveals two additional forms poised within the beige orbs—much smaller yellow circles. These subtle, almost unnoticeable, insertions change the narrative flow of the image, introducing a more intimate scale into the overall sweep of the composition, and also raising the spectre of content. One thinks, for instance, of a fertilized embryo, of cells dividing, as quickly as one hesitates to ascribe such an impulse to spores. Regardless, Olitski’s capacity to inflect large pictorial propositions with small assertions of color and form is evidenced, announcing a strategy that will recur throughout his oeuvre.</P><P> </P><P>The paintings of 1960, triggered by Mushroom Joy, are equally large in format, and often explore a similar dual orb motif. Works like Untitled—Seven (1960) and Untitled—Eight (1960) vertically posit concentric rings of color. Although seemingly flat in appearance, the surface of these paintings is worked over, sometimes obscuring prior forms. The green ground of Untitled—Eight, for instance, is applied over what was previously a yellow surface, allowing flecks of yellow to show through—trapped and isolated inflections. Within the teal that rings both orbs, there is not only evidence of under-painting but also of rhythmic, directional brushwork, masking earlier propositions. In these paintings, one sees Olitski making and re-making his forms, seeking to clarify and compose. His revisions, which allow for pentimenti, are not arduous and never become impasto, but they do indicate the changeable and fluid nature of these paintings.</P><P> </P><P>Executed in magna acrylic, with a hot bright palette, these works chart a path of distillation, moving from the brushy clustered masses of Untitled—Three (1960) to the bold, arresting composition of Fanny D (1960), a watershed work which fully anticipates, by two years, the better known—if not iconic—paintings House of Orange (1962) and Pink Love—Homage to Ken Noland (1962). Despite the apparent simplicity and efficiency of Fanny D, Olitski actually labored over the individual circles, altering the color of the individual small orbs; the near-black form was initially</P><P>a second green orb, later darkened by a very deep purple. Rather than plan his paintings or work from sketches, Olitski used the surfaces of his canvases as decision-making arenas. </P><P> </P><P>At this time, Olitski was beginning to receive attention for his work. He participated in the 1961 Pittsburgh International Exhibition of Painting and Sculpture at the Carnegie Institute, and was awarded the second prize for Osculum Silence (1960), a large painting of a central blue oval form, bisected by a wide, curved slash of yellow, which was subsequently acquired by The Museum of Modern Art in New York. In Spring of 1961, he showed for the first time with Elinor Poindexter, further propelling the highly successful trajectory that came to characterize the entire decade. Olitski went on to represent the United States at the 1966 Venice Biennale and to become, in 1969, the first living American artist to receive a solo exhibition at the Metropolitan Museum of Art.</P><P> </P><P>The painting Fanny D encapsulates Olitski’s vision—serving as an indicator of the future. It is remarkable, not simply for its compositional structure, which imposes a natural rhythm upon Noland’s and Jasper Johns’ notions of the target, but also for its improbable color scheme. In 1960, pink was not a color associated with serious painting. In fact, beyond an association with flesh tones (as it occurs in de Kooning’s work), pink was not sanctioned within the palette of abstraction. Olitski’s pink is hot, pulsing, and plastic. It cannot be linked to flesh, or to any other thing outside of its definitional pinkness—and, in this sense, it is a paradigmatic statement for the artist. Situated off-center, encircling a cluster of other colored circles, the pink form is the central attribute of Fanny D, declaring new possibilities for color and for painting.</P><P> </P><P>To comprehend this brazen chromatic assertion, one might project back through the critical writing of the 1960s, and borrow from Michael Fried’s seminal 1965 essay, “Three American Painters,” in which he grappled with the sheer novelty of Olitski’s chromatic sensibility. Proposing the term “color-situation,” Fried wrote of Olitski’s ambition “. . . to prove that any colors—literally, any colors—can be combined to produce major art. Toward this end, he often employs combinations of colors which at first sight appear vulgar, over-pretty, or garishly sentimental . . . [yet Olitski succeeds] in constructing color-situations of great originality, subtlety and force, thereby both discovering and exploiting expressive resources which would not otherwise have been suspected to exist.”5</P><P> </P><P>Fried likened the impact of an Olitski painting to a revelation, surmising that his paintings deliver to the viewer “something more real” or “more intense” than previous experience.6 By working beyond a traditional palette, Olitski achieves an arresting, individualized conception of painting.</P><P> </P><P>Realizing that color had become the preeminent “medium of painting,”7 Fried astutely outlined the effect of Olitski’s paintings upon the viewer—using phrases like “purely visual” to connote the work’s optical impact and immediacy. Fried relied upon the formalist parlance first implemented by Greenberg who had, only two years earlier, forcefully set out the parameters of interpretation for Olitski’s work. In an essay published in Canadian Art magazine, to accompany an exhibition Greenberg arranged for the Norman Mackenzie Art Gallery at the University of Saskatchewan, Regina, he concluded with an argument in favor of pure feeling:</P><P> </P><P>“I want to warn the observer that the configurations in the paintings. . . are not meant as images, and do not act as images; they are far too abstract. They act to organize the picture field into eloquence. And it is for the sake of eloquence, not for the sake of “symbols,” that [Olitski] abandoned representational painting. . . . Olitski is not interested in openings and spots as such, but in interlocking and color. And yet the color, the verticality, the concentricity, and the interlocking are not there for their own sakes. They are there, first and foremost, for the sake of feeling, and as vehicles of feeling. And if these paintings fail as vehicles and expressions of feeling, they fail entirely.” 8</P><P> </P><P>Greenberg described Olitski’s paintings as “eloquent,” and contended that the impact of an Olitski painting upon the viewer can be indexed through—for lack of a better word—“feeling.” Wholly abstract in content, the notion of feeling seems proximate and subjective. What feelings should bright pink elicit? What kind of response should Fanny D command, beyond the realm of feeling?</P><P> </P><P>When re-reading the criticism that propelled Olitski’s rise in the early 1960s, there seems to be a disconnect between the rigid formal discourse and the lush reality of the painter’s palette. When Olitski’s possibly “vulgar, over pretty, or garishly sentimental” preferences (Fried’s terms), are coupled with his penchant for indulgent titles, he appears less concerned with formal structure than, rather, engaged in a quest to seek pleasure through paint. One of the two paintings that Greenberg featured in his 1963 article carries the alliterative title Purple Passion Company (1962), which seems more an erotic invocation than an ascription of pure formal “elegance.”</P><P> </P><P>Among Olitski’s early champions—Greenberg, Fried, and the young Rosalind Krauss9—there is conspicuous denial of the significance of titling. Their shared assumption was that titles play a merely designative role, enabling identification. However, if one considers the titles of Olitski’s work, which he always applied after a painting was completed, clear themes emerge. In the early 1960s, his titles can loosely be divided into three coherent groups: those referencing his Russian origins; abstract, associative titles; and, most tellingly, what one might refer to as titles of passion, that convey sensuality, pleasure, jouissance—perhaps the artist’s most common trope. Consider the following titles, of works in this exhibition, all of which serve either as invocations of pleasure: Mushroom Joy, Medusa Pleasure, New Love; or of women: Fanny Dimes, Fanny D, Lucy’s Fancy, Yaksi Darling, and Fair Charlotte. Other titles of major paintings from this era include The Blush (1960), Into Delight (1962), and Cleopatra Flesh (1962).</P><P> </P><P>If Olitski himself slipped into a formalist mode of describing his work and creative process, in various statements and interviews throughout the 1960s and 1970s, by the mid-1980s his approach had shifted—becoming more intuitive, speculative, and even romantic. In an introspective autobiographical essay from 1985, Olitski wrestled to describe “my belief in some power outside of myself [that] was there all along.” He likened his working experience, which unfolds through constant work, to a mystical quest, seeking contact with this presence: “While painting away in my studio, an event would occur that I couldn’t explain, and which I called inspiration. It would feel as if I were being given over to something, to a force, working through me. Afterward, I never could remember the sequence of events.”10</P><P> </P><P>There is a near spiritual embrace of the creative process, which seems distant from the arid rigor of prior formalist accounts. In his essay, Olitski cited Goethe and Shakespeare, referenced Matisse and Klee, and quoted phrases from Emerson and William James. His lifelong task as an artist emerges as the constant struggle to seek knowledge of the self, to wrest insight from God—which he dwelt upon explicitly. Quoting Emerson, Olitski wrote of a rapture that could result from painting: “Do the thing and you will have the power.”11 And, like a Transcendentalist, he elaborated his understanding of this “higher power”:</P><P> </P><P>“I don’t know its natural shape, nor do I need to know it. Enough that I have found my way to it. What remains is to bring the power into all areas of my existence so that, in communing with the power, it may work on me as I believe it does on my art.” 12</P><P> </P><P>Olitski published this essay in an exhibition catalogue that spanned his entire career, from the early 1960s through 1985, suggesting that his spiritual insight be applied to featured paintings such as House of Orange or Pink Love— Homage to Ken Noland. And, as one examines his more recent work, it becomes apparent that his concern for passion—as a paradigm for abstraction—remained constant. With Love and Disregard is the title that he chose for a series of works he completed in 2002.</P><P> </P><P>Olitski’s oeuvre, despite apparent breaks and rapid evolutionary chapters from the late 1950s through the end of the 1960s and beyond, is remarkably coherent at the level of content—a word that would have been anathema to Greenberg, for such a notion smacks of representation. But colors like pink, which become a constant in Olitski’s oeuvre since its bold appearance in Fanny D, are determined by the wider culture, and cannot but have a range of colloquial connotations that override the purely formal. Such a balancing of opposites is Olitski’s enduring strength as an artist—his ability to convert passion and romance into pure form.</P><P> </P><P>The rigor of Olitski’s quest is borne out by remarkably diverse paintings and, as a coda to the group of breakthrough pictures that orients his mature trajectory (the paintings from 1960–1961), one might consider two little known works: Early North Light (1958) and Love Again (1964). These two paintings bracket Olitski’s approach, encapsulating his range of pictorial possibility. Early North Light is an intimately scaled, purely abstract, spackle canvas. Forcefully applied, cascading vertical strokes display a rapid energy. The painting depicts a glimpse, a natural view—the brink of where representational painting enters material abstraction, entirely, unremittingly. The idea of dawning light is Olitski’s sign of creation, or rather Creation. Love Again represents an opposite proposition. A blank canvas, the expanse of its weave everywhere declared, is punctuated by three small circles of color, placed at the upper right. These marks declare the sleek modern capacity of Olitski’s art: thrilling in their simplicity, fecund and fertile in implication. This image qualifies Fried’s idea, an ideal really, of a “color-situation”—a visual phenomenon not previously thought to exist.</P><P> </P><P> </P><P>1 Jules Olitski, The Courage of Conviction, ed.

The lake itself is named after John Wentworth the last British governor of New Hampshire and Olitski’s title joins images of Wentworth with his own impassioned, late night painting sessions.</P><P> </P><P>3 Kenworth Moffett, Jules Olitski (New York: Harry N.

In another passage Fried registers the impact of Olitski’s paintings from 1964: “each painting is an attempt to achieve a unique and highly precarious equilibrium of shapes and colors, related to that achieved in traditional painting by the resolution of tactile forces and the juxtaposition of tactile shapes in an instantaneously perceived compositional whole. But the forces at work in Olitski’s paintings are color-forces, and can be perceived only in visual time; and the paintings themselves are addressed to eyesight alone.” (Fried, 38).</P><P> </P><P>7 Fried uses this phrase in a later essay, Jules Olitski, in Jules Olitski: Paintings, 1963- 1967, exhibition catalogue (Washington, D.C.: Corcoran Gallery of Art, 1967), 19.</P><P> </P><P>8 Clement Greenberg, 3 New American Painters, Canadian Art, 20: 3 (May-June 1963), 175.
